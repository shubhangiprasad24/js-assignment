    <h2>Question 2. An interger number grater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself. </br>
        In other words, n>1 is a prime if it can't be evenly divided by anything excepy 1 and n.</br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be dividedwithour the remainder by 2, 3, 4.
